# DSP56001 implementation notes

The local `docs/DSP56001_um.pdf` is the architectural reference for the DSP
side. The current DSP core relies on these specific rules from the Motorola
DSP56000/DSP56001 User's Manual.

## Numeric representation

Section 4.2, “Data Representation and Rounding” (manual pages 4-9 onward),
defines data-ALU words as signed 24-bit fractional values with the binary point
left justified. The same bit patterns can be manipulated as small integers with
logical shifts and adds, as the current synthesis kernel does, but future use of
`MPY`/`MAC`, scaling mode, rounding, or accumulator limiting must account for
the fractional alignment explicitly. Generated ymfm lookup values are emitted
as raw 24-bit words rather than silently rescaled constants.

## Address-generation pipeline

Section 8.1, pipeline Case 2 (manual page 8-2), states that an indirect address
is formed before the preceding `MOVE` has finished writing its `Rn` register.
One independent instruction cycle is required between writing `Rn` and using
it for an indirect memory access. The same scheduling discipline is used for
the `Nn` offsets in `src/dsp/ym2151.asm`. Where there is no useful independent
instruction, the core inserts a `NOP` before `x:(Rn+Nn)` or `y:(Rn+Nn)`.

Indexed and post-update addressing only pair same-numbered registers:
`(Rn+Nn)` and `(Rn)+Nn` exist, but `(R7+N5)` does not assemble. Address
arithmetic also always applies the pointer's own `Mn` modifier, so an indexed
access through a modulo pointer must keep base plus offset inside one modulo
block. Both rules shaped the decoded-control state layout of protocol
command `$17`: its per-operator arrays are operator-major so the channel's
feedback pointer can index them, and its modulo-sensitive tables are placed
so a stride-8 walk never leaves a 64-word block.

## Hardware loops

The `DO` instruction description (manual pages A-63 through A-65) confirms that
the loop has no per-iteration overhead, but a count of zero means 65,536
iterations rather than zero. Variable-count loops in the synthesis kernel
therefore branch around `DO` when the count can be zero. Section 8.1.2 (manual pages 8-6
onward) also lists instructions forbidden near a loop end; loop bodies here are
kept to simple ALU or memory moves and are checked by Motorola ASM56000.

These constraints are part of correctness, not just optimization: violating
either the address delay or zero-count behavior produces valid assembly with
incorrect chip state at runtime.

## First synthesis hot-path pass

Deriving one OPM phase increment includes key-code gap removal, DT1/DT2 table
access, octave shifting, multiplier handling, and PM sensitivity. Repeating
that static work for all 32 operators on every sample dominated the initial
correctness-oriented kernel. The DSP now caches the no-PM increments and
rebuilds them after writes to the register groups that can contain KC/KF,
DT1/MUL, or DT2. The same rebuild pass stores five PM-independent words per
operator in internal `Y:$0000` — gap-removed position including DT2, raw
block, channel PM sensitivity, signed DT1 delta, and doubled multiplier — so
a non-zero per-sample LFO PM value now costs only the PM shift, boundary
adjustment, one table read, the octave shift, and one `MPY` per operator
instead of the complete register decode. The `tests/traces/vibrato_pm.trace`
fixture pins this dynamic path to exact ymfm output at maximum saw-LFO rate,
PM depth, and PMS.

The 32-word cache starts at internal `Y:$0100`. This keeps phase in X and its
increment in Y, allowing one parallel fetch followed by add/store: three
instructions per operator in the common no-PM path. It also avoids external
`Y:$0200`, which overlaps the external program address range under the Falcon
memory reservation used by this executable. The output path separately skips
four-operator evaluation when all four envelopes are `$3ff`, while explicitly
clocking that channel's next feedback input to zero. Released envelopes already
at `$3ff` bypass rate derivation until a later key-on makes them active again.
Phase, key edges, feedback history, LFO/noise, and timers continue to clock.

Frequently accessed scalar state now occupies internal `X:$0000-$0041`.
Short-address loads and stores remove an extension word and avoid external RAM;
this reduced the initialized loader payload from 8,100 to 7,113 bytes before
adding the FIFO and audio transport. The buffered-audio image later reached 8,082
bytes, which motivated the second-stage loader described below rather than
making code size part of the synthesis contract.

## Falcon SSI interrupt-buffered mixed path

The audio path configures SSI control A as `$4100`: 16-bit words and two words
per synchronous network frame. Control B is `$5a00`: synchronous network mode,
transmit enabled, and transmit interrupts enabled, while serial clock and
transmit frame sync remain crossbar inputs. SSI priority is level 2 through IPR
`$3000`. Each signed 16-bit YM sample is shifted into the upper 16 bits of the
DSP's 24-bit transmit register.

Those values are the ones the matrix requires rather than a free choice. The
Falcon specification defines a continuous-clock frame as 128 bit clocks
carrying eight 16-bit samples, with SYNC high for the first 16 bits and low
for the remaining 96. Word-length frame sync (`FSL1:FSL0 = 0`) matches that
pulse, the two-word frame from `CRA` DC=1 fills slots 0 and 1 and idles for
the rest of the frame, and the specification's statement that the DAC port
cannot operate in gated clock mode is why the host connects with no
handshaking. Port C resets to GPIO, so `PCC = $1f8` — bits 3 through 8, the
SSI group in section 11 of the user's manual — is what gives the slave SSI its
clock and frame sync at all; without it the transmitter is clockless on
hardware while Hatari still runs. Which pair of the eight slots reaches the
DAC is a matrix-side selection, covered in
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md).

The normal SSI transmit vector at `P:$0010` is a two-instruction fast interrupt:
it moves `X:(r6)+` to TX and returns through the implicit fast-interrupt path.
The dedicated `r6/m6` pair is not used by synthesis, so refills can be
interrupted without saving ALU state or disturbing a hardware `DO` loop. The
transmit-exception vector at `P:$0012` is a long interrupt that reads SSISR and
then writes TX, the required sequence for clearing TUE. It is a recovery path,
not part of normal block playback — and because Hatari's DAC starvation model
is invented rather than measured, no gate has ever starved the SSI, so this
vector has never executed in a passing run. It is listed among the untested
paths in [`architecture.md`](architecture.md).

The Falcon DAC rate selected by the production host is 25.175 MHz divided by
4 and 192, or 32,779.9479167 Hz. Relative to the native 62,500 Hz OPM rate
this is exactly `1920/1007`. Each production period has 512 stereo frames, or
1024 interleaved SSI words. Buffer A starts at external `X:$1000`, buffer B at
`X:$1800`, and `m6=1023` wraps either power-of-two period. They are
uninitialized storage, add no `.LOD` records, and both fit below the 8192-word
external-X reservation.

Protocol commands `$11`/`$13` retain the older 1007-frame exact-renderer
interface for conformance tests. They are not the production playback path at
the 32.780 kHz clock. Commands `$18`/`$19` select and fill the inactive
512-frame buffer while `r6` transmits the active one, then switch only on a
whole-period boundary. Buffer pointers use `r6/r7`; the phase-cache loop owns
`r4`, so sharing that register would displace the refill position during every
YM sample.

Protocol v24 implements the event shape with a rolling clock. A refillable
32-entry ring FIFO stores an absolute 16-bit native-sample time beside each
packed register write. Entries must be in nondecreasing modular order and
within the 32,767-sample future horizon; all writes due at a boundary are
applied before clocking that YM sample. FIFO and clock-query transactions are
serviced while SSI is active, and the clock continues across refills instead of
restarting at zero.

### Production realtime mixed path

Protocol commands `$18` and `$19` use the integrated command-`$17` block kernel
for normal playback while preserving commands `$11`/`$13` as the exact
conformance stream. Each realtime transaction transfers a count and up to 64
ordered YM writes, the common PCM8 pan, and 512 signed mono PDX frames. The
DSP stages the writes without decoding them while TOS performs its unpaced
bulk transfer, queues them at the current rolling timestamp after the PCM has
arrived, and expands each mono sample by eight bits into the selected planar
24-bit accumulator(s). The receive path applies a two-tap
`(current+previous)/2` PCM reconstruction filter, then renders 16 32-frame FM
blocks into the inactive 1024-word interleaved SSI buffer. Quality playback
uses `m6=1023`; the exact 1007-frame conformance stream retains `m6=2013`.

Start imports the exact register and key image into persistent decoded state,
clears phase and feedback, rebuilds pitch/gain/envelope state, backs up the
packed table, derives the 32-step noise jump tables, and maps the sine ROM.
Refill selects the inactive planar workspace and SSI output buffer and receives
the next host period behind a ready-token gate. Once the upload is private DSP
memory it acknowledges the host, allowing the 16 MHz 68030 to mix the following
period while the DSP renders. The completed output waits for `r6` to wrap to
the active buffer base and switches only at a whole 512-frame boundary. Stop
restores the packed tables, exact expanded tables and caches, external Y
mapping, SSI state, and linear address modifiers.

The realtime LFO is a 48-bit accumulator holding ymfm's 32-bit counter times
2^18, advanced by decoded 61/62-tick pairs, so the true waveform index —
counter bits 22-29 — is the high word's top byte. Each block derives ymfm's
waveform AM byte from it (the noise waveform samples the Galois LFSR's low
byte as a documented approximation), publishes `m_lfo_am = am*AMD>>7`, turns
it into one `2^(-(am<<(AMS-1))/64)` multiplier per sensitivity through the
envelope fraction table, and rescales the live gain pairs of every channel
whose AMS is (or just stopped being) nonzero from AM-free base pairs;
operators opt in through D1R bit 7 exactly as on chip. The same index byte
feeds the block PM value: ymfm's `m_lfo_pm` from the waveform's signed PM
shape times the `$19` depth, shifted per channel by PMS into a delta in
1/64 semitones exactly as `compute_phase_step` does. Instead of looking the
four phase steps up at the shifted position every block, the kernel
multiplies the channel's PM-free base increments by `2^(delta/768)` from
`rt5_pm_multiplier`, 1024 words at external `Y:$3800` divided out of the
chip-verified phase-step table at every realtime start (`T[j]/(2*T[0])`,
one octave down `T[j]/(4*T[0])`, 24-step `DIV`, exactly the truncated
quotient). That reproduces the depth law of the same table and differs
from ymfm only by the DT1 detune riding the multiplier, a fraction of a
percent at PMS 7; the `lfo-pm` scenario grades the phase advance per
quarter within 2%. The pass costs about 45 cycles per PM channel and block
and skips entirely while the depth or the block's PM value is zero.

The amplitude convention matches ymfm's relative levels: a full-volume
operator peaks at 2^21 of the 0.23 domain — one quarter of the signed
output range, exactly ymfm's 8191 of 16 bits — so a four-carrier channel
sums to full scale without invoking the accumulator limiter, PCM and FM
share headroom correctly, and the modulation-scale multiplier ($1000,
2^-11) lands ring words at ymfm's exact out>>1 serial depth. Getting
either scale wrong shows up spectrally, not just in level: 4x-deep
modulation buries fundamentals under high-order sidebands, and clipped
carrier sums counterfeit harmonics that vanish once levels are right.

The all-carrier algorithm's first operator needs two products per frame — its
ring word uses the audible carrier gain while its feedback history uses the
independently decoded feedback gain — and the data ALU has exactly two Y
registers, both taken by the block gain and the ring mask. The dedicated stage escapes the register
wall with a modulo-2 address ring: r5 walks a two-word internal gain pair
under m5 = 1, and each of the loop's two `mpyr` instructions consumes the
previous y0 while its parallel Y load fetches the other gain, so the gains
alternate at zero instruction cost. The stage costs two instructions per
frame over the standard loop with every access internal, and only
algorithm-7 channels with nonzero feedback pay it.

The production block boundary drains the real 32-entry transport FIFO and uses
the same register decoder for direct live writes. Algorithm/pan, TL, KC/KF,
MUL, key edges, envelope rates, LFO, and timers update persistent state. The
1920:1007 DDA advances successive 512-frame buffers to native clocks 976,
1952, and 2928 without drift. An event landing inside a 32-frame block splits
that block into ordered segments and takes effect on its first codec frame.
DT1/DT2 pitch offsets and channel-7 noise frequency/output substitution are
decoded by the production kernel. The Hatari smoke gate renders three buffers,
checks 1536 prepared frames, and pins the first attack buffer checksum to
`$f8c040`.

## Cycle feasibility gate

The Falcon DSP oscillator measured by Hatari is 32,084,988 Hz. One DSP56001
instruction cycle is two oscillator clocks, leaving about 256.68 instruction
cycles for each native 62.5 kHz YM sample.

The memory-cost model behind every number in this section is Hatari's, and it
is deliberately simplified: its DSP core treats Falcon external memory as
zero wait states and ignores the bus control register (which the kernel
therefore clears itself at `start:`, since reset leaves fifteen wait states
and the `Dsp_ExecBoot` path never passes through the TOS loader), charging instead two
extra cycles whenever a single instruction reaches more than one external
space. Instruction fetch counts as a P access, so a hot instruction living in
one of the `P:$2000` islands pays that penalty as soon as it also touches
external X or Y, and an internal-P instruction pays it for an external-X plus
external-Y parallel move. That is the rule behind the placement decisions
recorded here — the envelope pass in internal P, the phase cache in internal
Y, gain pairs in internal X — and it is also the lever for recovering the
remaining margin, because those instruction pairs can be located statically
before any rewrite. The model is credible for placement work but not for
transport timing: Hatari's own documentation states that DSP emulation is
instruction-wise correct and not cycle accurate, particularly for
68030-to-DSP synchronization, so underrun behavior remains a hardware-soak
question.

Two inputs to every cycle figure below are themselves modeled rather than
measured on hardware. Whatever TOS leaves in the DSP bus control register is
not represented at all, so if the real wait-state configuration is non-zero,
the per-access cost this kernel was optimized against is systematically low —
and this kernel is deliberately external-memory dense. The oscillator figure
of 32,084,988 Hz is likewise Hatari's; a small difference on real hardware
scales every budget here proportionally. The figure itself is not in doubt,
but the rate at which stock Hatari hands those cycles to the DSP was: it
delivers two per emulated 68030 clock twice over, so every real-time gate ran
against a 32 MIPS DSP. The budgets below were always derived from
`oscillator / 2`, so they describe the hardware correctly; it was the
emulated machine, not the arithmetic, that was twice too fast. Neither invalidates the placement
conclusions, which depend on relative cost, but both bear on how much of the
reported headroom actually exists. `make profile-dsp` arms Hatari's DSP
profiler on a unique host-port marker, then measures command `$0b` from entry
through completion of the first 1280-native-sample render. Listing symbols are
resolved mechanically, and the generated report is written to
`build/dsp-profile/report.txt`.

The deterministic fixture enables a sustained four-operator algorithm-7 voice
on all eight channels and deliberately uses the cached no-PM phase path. Hatari
reports 31,414,310 oscillator clocks, or 15,707,155 instruction cycles,
for the block. That is 12,271.21 instruction cycles per native sample and
979.10 ms of modeled DSP time for audio consumed in 20.48 ms: a 47.81x
real-time miss. The stock and DSP-calibrated Hatari builds report this figure
identically, as they do every bracketed profile here: the per-instruction cost
model is the same in both, and only the rate of cycle delivery differs. The profile window does not include steady SSI interrupt or
host-port service overhead, and a PM-modulated workload can only be more
expensive. This replaces the earlier 8.6x estimate derived indirectly from a
VBL throughput test.

The result makes full-rate, ymfm-equivalent output from the current scalar
kernel an untenable optimization target. The exact kernel remains useful as a
conformance model, but a real-time Falcon renderer now requires an explicit
compromise in output accuracy, synthesis rate, supported workload, or target
hardware. Real Falcon cycle and underrun measurements are still required to
validate transport behavior, but plausible emulator timing error cannot close
a nearly 47x gap.

### Codec-rate lower-bound spike

`make profile-dsp-rt` brackets protocol command `$10` between
`rt_profile_loop_start` and `rt_profile_loop_done` and writes the independent
report to `build/dsp-profile-rt/report.txt`. The command clocks 2,048 frames of
one four-operator channel at the 49,169.921875 Hz codec cadence. Each oscillator
retains a 16-bit fractional phase in an aligned internal-X modulo-4 ring while
`r0-r3` retain the integer positions in the DSP56001's on-chip 256-entry sine
ROM at `Y:$0100-$01ff`. Fractional carry advances each integer pointer without
long-term pitch drift.

The optimized loop keeps four static gains in internal X, so each phase mask
dual-fetches sine and gain while the following `MAC` overlaps its phase-ring
store. Hatari reports 80,208 instruction cycles, or 39.16 cycles per
channel/frame. A linear eight-channel pass is 313.31 cycles against the
measured 326.27-cycle codec-frame budget, leaving only 12.96 cycles (4.0%).
The four distinct gain multipliers exercise the carrier floor; the checksum is
`$6c679b` and the normal smoke suite checks it. Command cleanup unmaps the ROM
and rebuilds the exact-renderer phase cache outside the measured bracket.

This is deliberately a strict floor: it omits envelope evolution, feedback,
modulation routing, LFO/noise, write-event service, panning, SSI, and PDX/FM
saturation. It does not establish that a complete scalar engine fits; it
establishes that drift-free oscillator/table arithmetic is viable only when
organized around DSP parallel moves. The integrated production path described
above is the block-oriented, algorithm-specialized implementation that closes
that feasibility gap; this lower-bound spike remains useful as a historical
cost reference.

### Algorithm-0 block spike

`make profile-dsp-rt2` brackets protocol command `$14` between
`rt2_profile_loop_start` and `rt2_profile_loop_done` and writes its report to
`build/dsp-profile-rt2/report.txt`. The command renders one serial
M1(feedback)->C1->M2->C2 channel for 2048 codec frames in operator-major
64-frame blocks: each stage keeps its phase in a 48-bit accumulator, writes a
64-word internal-X modulator ring, and the next stage consumes that ring in
place. Feedback and modulation are applied on every frame; operator gains are
held for each block and envelope evolution is deliberately outside this
synthesis-only spike. The carrier writes interleaved stereo into the reused
audio buffers, and the reply is that block's checksum (`$0f2666`), gated by
the smoke suite.

The optimized loop stores feedback history across internal X/Y memory at its
already-divided 1/8 table-index depth, so both words load together and their
sum feeds the phase without three hot-loop shifts. It fetches and updates both
words with the modulator ring, prefetches the next
ring word beside each modulated-stage `MPY`, transfers that word into `A` while
storing the previous result, and overlaps the carrier's left output store with
its right-pan shift. A `$ff` address mask keeps every indexed read inside the
DSP56001's factory 256-step signed sine ROM at `Y:$0100-$01ff`; the same value
is the phase MAC operand. Its rounded `$9330` multiplicand is five parts per
million low, so one `$60000` low-word correction after the 2,048-frame profile
block restores exact boundary phase while the intermediate error stays below
0.012 ROM step. Command setup temporarily enables that ROM, then restores the
external map and rebuilds the cache words overlaid by the 48-bit spike state.

Hatari measures 77,307 instruction cycles for the block, or 37.75 cycles per
channel/frame. This is 37.2% below the first 60.10-cycle implementation and
1.41 cycles below the generic 39.16-cycle four-carrier floor because the block
stages eliminate fractional-ring traffic from every operator. The linear
eight-channel projection is 301.98 cycles against the 326.27-cycle codec-frame
budget, leaving 24.29 cycles (7.44%) of synthesis margin. Envelope evolution,
LFO/noise, queued-write,
SSI, and event-service costs are still absent, so this closes the arithmetic
spike gap rather than proving an integrated real-time renderer.

### Algorithm-7 carrier spike

`make profile-dsp-rt3` brackets protocol command `$15` between
`rt3_profile_loop_start` and `rt3_profile_loop_done` and writes
`build/dsp-profile-rt3/report.txt`. It shares command `$14`'s ROM mapping,
48-bit DDA, feedback history, block size, output buffers, correction, and
cleanup, but routes all four operators as carriers. Operator 1 stores its
feedback pre-scaled by 1/8, preserving the serial spike's feedback depth while
placing a separate half-amplitude carrier in the accumulation ring.

Operators 2-4 have no incoming modulation, so each masks `B` directly and
preloads the current ring word beside that mask. A following `MAC` adds the
sine/gain product in place, eliminating a separate `MPY` and `ADD` from each
carrier stage; operator 4 overlaps the left output store with the right-pan
shift. The four gains sum to 0.9375 at aligned phase, keeping the unsaturated
test vector inside signed full scale. The deterministic reply is `$89eb00`.

Hatari measures 77,211 instruction cycles, or 37.70 cycles per channel/frame.
The linear eight-channel projection is 301.61 cycles per codec frame, leaving
24.66 cycles (7.56%) of synthesis headroom. This is 0.13% cheaper than the
optimized fully serial algorithm-0 shape and establishes useful
carrier-specialization headroom, but still excludes envelope, LFO/noise,
queued-write, SSI, and event service.

### Algorithms 1-6 mixed-topology spikes

`make profile-dsp-rt4` captures protocol command `$16` once for each selector
1-6 and writes the reports below
`build/dsp-profile-rt4/algorithm-*/report.txt`. The six outer loops compose
shared feedback, serial-modulator, independent-carrier, carrier-accumulation,
and stereo-output stages while retaining separate listing symbols for Hatari's
cycle brackets. Their deterministic replies are checked by the normal smoke
test.

Operator 1 stores its output at the already-divided 1/8 feedback depth. That
keeps the same feedback strength as the three shifts in command `$14`, removes
those shifts from every mixed-topology frame, and still gives later operators
non-zero table-index modulation. Algorithms 1-3 use one internal-X ring for
their fan-in paths. Algorithms 4 and 5 instead preserve reusable modulation in
the internal-Y ring at `Y:$00c0-$00ff` and accumulate carriers in internal X.
After the modulated phase selects a sine entry, the phase `MAC` preloads the X
carrier accumulation before the indexed Y sine-ROM read, avoiding the Y/Y
memory conflict in the first dual-branch implementation. Algorithm 6 reuses
the direct X carrier-accumulation stage from command `$15` after its one serial
branch.

| Algorithm | Channel cycles/frame | Eight-channel projection | Synthesis headroom |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 37.00 | 295.99 | 9.28% |
| 2 | 37.98 | 303.87 | 6.87% |
| 3 | 37.00 | 295.99 | 9.28% |
| 4 | 38.00 | 303.99 | 6.83% |
| 5 | 39.05 | 312.37 | 4.26% |
| 6 | 35.98 | 287.86 | 11.77% |

All six mixed topologies fit their linear eight-channel synthesis projection.
After algorithm 0's scaled-feedback optimization, algorithm 5 is the overall
isolated worst case at 39.05 cycles and leaves 4.26%. These are still
synthesis-only results: block-rate envelope work, LFO/noise, queued writes,
SSI, saturation, and event service are not included.

### Live-SSI eight-channel fully decoded control gate

`make profile-dsp-rt5` brackets protocol command `$17` between
`rt5_profile_loop_start` and `rt5_profile_loop_done` and writes
`build/dsp-profile-rt5/report.txt`. It is the first profile to execute eight
channels, one for each algorithm, rather than projecting one channel linearly.
The sine ROM
moves to `r0`, leaving `r6/m6` exclusively owned by the real two-word SSI fast
interrupt while buffer A loops. Thirty-two long phases and eight feedback
pairs overlay the exact renderer's internal cache/scratch range at
`L:$0054-$007b`; the cache is rebuilt before returning to the command loop.
Both-output carriers reuse the internal-Y algorithm-4/5 branch ring. Left-only
and right-only carriers accumulate into host-prepared planar PDX streams in
external X/Y memory, which the final pass combines with the common ring and
interleaves into the inactive SSI buffer. All profile arrays remain inside
Falcon's 8,192-word X/Y reservations. The right stream temporarily overlays
external-Y table storage, so the packed table is backed up in X and expanded
again before the exact renderer resumes.

Each 32-frame block drains every due ordered write from a profile-local
FIFO — the fixture schedules one write at each of the first 25 boundaries, a
seven-event burst at boundary 24, the shape of a real MXDRV voice load, and
a late boundary-90 key-off — advances the drift-free 1920:1007 native
clock, a decoded-rate LFO, both decoded timers, and a maximum-length
one-step-per-frame noise LFSR, runs one two-instruction, 32-iteration loop
that rebuilds every PM-adjusted per-operator phase increment, and tail-calls
the internal-P envelope pass described below. Pitch state is operator-major
(slot = operator * 8 + channel), so each algorithm body preloads its stages'
increments through the channel's feedback pointer as `y:(r2+n2)` beside the
existing `x:(r7+n7)` gain preload, and the channel-control read rides the
parallel Y-bank feedback pointer through `(r4+n4)`. The 32-event fixture
covers every decoded register class: eight `$20-$27` algorithm/pan rewrites,
five four-band total-level writes, four KC and two KF events that rebuild
four base increments from the exact expanded `opm_phase_step` table with
octave shift and doubled per-operator multiplier — converted to block DDA
units through the `2^20/(68*1007)` scale that matches the lower-rate render's
phase mac against the 256-step sine ROM, exact to 0.04 ppm
with only past-Nyquist tones wrapping into the signed alias domain —
five key on/off edges
driving real attack/release state, one write from each of the four
envelope-rate groups that rebuilds the live affine constants when its class
matches the operator's ADSR state, LFO rate/depth/waveform writes, and
Timer B plus timer control load/run/status handling. The `$19` PM depth
and each channel's PMS drive the block PM multiplier pass described under
the production path, and
control bit 16 still selects full or 0.75 AM gain in all four stages.
Full-accumulator moves invoke the DSP56001 limiter only after the complete
mix. The exact 32-step Galois noise transform is applied through three
6/6/5-bit slice tables that command setup derives from the x^17+x^14+1 step
function itself — 17 single-bit columns advanced 32 steps, then a doubling
fill — so no noise-table words occupy the bounded P-memory image. Cleanup
disables SSI, reads SSISR and writes TX to clear a latched underrun,
restores the external Y map, and rebuilds the exact phase cache, including
the internal-Y frequency-cache words the decoded multiplier/increment arrays
overlay. The deterministic reply is `$984e55`.

Decoded envelope curvature runs as a block-boundary pass at `P:$0080` in
internal P RAM, where instruction fetches avoid the external-memory penalty.
Every envelope-active operator advances once per block by one composed
full-block affine step, `level' = a*level + b` in 10.13 fixed point, whose
per-rate constants `tools/generate_envelope_tables.py` composes from the
exact ymfm per-tick recurrence over the average 20.337 envelope ticks per
block: attack multiplies toward its exact fixed point at -1 (the addend is
derived on the DSP as `a - 1`), and decay/sustain/release accumulate exact
mean increments. Boundary checks apply the ADSR transitions — attack
completes below four attenuation units in the block where the exact
recurrence lands on zero, decay compares a sustain target cached at decay
entry, and anything reaching full attenuation pins, silences its gains, and
retires. A zero addend proves an operator can never move again, so it
retires after one gain rebuild; retirement swaps the active-list tail into
the walked slot. Gains rebuild as `tl * 2^(-level/64)` through a generated
64-entry fraction table and per-octave shift, and only when the 10-bit
attenuation actually moved. The amortized helpers — effective-rate decode
with KSR, key/rate/total-level event handlers, and the activation list —
live in the external island with the generated tables. The capture harness
derives mid-block levels analytically from the same defining recurrence, so
no mid-block state is stored.

Hatari measures 2,757,432 instruction cycles for 8,192 frames over 256
blocks, or 336.60 cycles per frame against the 489.40-cycle budget, leaving
152.80 cycles (31.2%). The 171.88 ms modeled span fits its 249.91 ms period.
Those 152.80 cycles are not all spare capacity. The window is bracketed between
two render markers, so it excludes the SSI transmit interrupt, the host-port
receive and the refill command; `make profile-dsp-live` measures the same DSP
across 128 whole production periods of Xevious and finds 391.80 cycles per
frame of synthesis and transport plus 0.44 stalled on the 68030, i.e. 80.1%
occupancy and a 97.16-cycle margin. At the true 16 MIPS DSP clock the pipelined
Xevious run lands all 1,109 steady boundaries exactly 1024 words apart, down
from 351 late of 759 before the optimization and 3 late of 1,103 after it. The
misses that remained at that stage arrived from the 68030 roughly one third of
a period late rather than exhausting the DSP's mean render budget, which is why
the producer/consumer pipeline cleared them without touching synthesis. See
[`hatari-timing.md`](hatari-timing.md).
The 256-block window amortizes the 32-event fixture at a realistic MXDRV
write density, and the envelope fixture exercises an eight-operator key-on
transient that decays to its sustain levels and retires, one sustained D2R
decay tail, and a late release that caps and retires — so steady-state
envelope cost is activity-proportional rather than a permanent 32-operator
tax. Every decoded register class the real transport must apply executes
inside the budget beside live SSI, planar PDX mixing, saturation, and
decoded envelope curvature. The write-first common-ring
pass has been spent. The unmodulated operator stages also carry the previous
ring store through the next phase mask and fetch the next sine word beside the
phase MAC; the feedback-add carrier multiply simultaneously preloads its X
accumulator and Y gain. Together those DSP56001 parallel moves reduce the
integrated gate by 18.07 cycles per frame without changing the command
checksum. The
block's first both-panned carrier stores instead of
accumulating, the rare unwritten ring is cleared once at emission, and both
write variants keep full-accumulator limiter moves so the checksum gate
proves the output bit-identical. Recovering the lever and the boundary drain
cost P-memory pressure: the key-event decode became a four-iteration
mask-shift loop, the fixed timer-register reads use absolute addressing, the
total-level gain bases moved into a four-entry P table, and the program
then ended one word below the P:$1400 table boundary; the envelope work
later reopened that room by moving the cold event-decode bodies and fixture
tables into the external island described below. Noise-frequency decode remains
outside this gate.

## Falcon external memory aliasing and the P:$2000 island

Hatari's Falcon decode (and the hardware it models) maps external P to the
32K SRAM directly, external Y onto the same lower 16K word for word, and
external X onto the upper 16K at `phys = addr + $4000`. That statement is the
emulator's, and this section builds on it more heavily than anything else in
the port: the islands below place program *into the gaps between live data
arrays*, so a decode that differs on real hardware by even one region corrupts
state silently instead of failing cleanly. Verify it on hardware with a
standalone probe — write a pattern through `Y:$2000`, read it back through
`P:$2000` and `X:$6000` — before trusting any audio result, as recorded in the
soak order in [`architecture.md`](architecture.md). The `P:$1400` ceiling
therefore only protects the Y-resident table region. The window from the end
of the external-Y reservation at `Y:$1f7f` through `Y:$26ff` is program space.
The island at `P:$2000-$2af6` holds the generated per-rate tables, amortized
envelope helpers, relocated cold event-decode bodies, rt5 fixtures, and the
exact global and timer helpers. A second island at `P:$2b20` sits just above
the envelope block addends at `Y:$2b00-$2b1f` and carries the per-class
algorithm entry heads, the exact independent feedback stages, the feedback
bypass stages, and the packed-dispatch rebuild helpers with their class-row
tables. The stage-two generator accepts a repeated `--island`
argument and admits P sections inside `[$2000,$2b00)` or `[$2b20,$3400)`,
rejecting everything else above `$1400`. The uninitialized envelope state
remains in `X:$2400`/`X:$2480` (physical `$6400`/`$6480`), while its Y addend
array at `Y:$2b00` separates the two program islands; nothing aliases either
island.

Three DSP56001 pitfalls bit during this work. A subroutine that parks a
modifier register (`m3` here) leaves a time bomb for every later `(r3)+`
walker: the dispatch-word rebuild once restored `m3` to the render map's 63
during cold init, and the noise-jump table generator — which runs later in
the same init and walks `r3` linearly — silently wrapped its writes inside
one 64-word block, corrupting scattered table entries whose effect surfaced
only as intermittent LFSR discontinuities blocks later. Helpers must leave
inherited modifiers untouched and keep their own indexed accesses wrap-free
by placement instead. REP with a register count of
zero executes 65,536 times, and `tst` sees the whole 56-bit accumulator, so
an octave count computed by fractional MPY must drop its A0/B0 fraction
bits (`move b1,b`) before the zero guard. And TOS 4.02's `Dsp_BlkUnpacked`
polls host-port TXDE only before its first word, then writes the rest of the
block blind: any command whose receive loop starts more than about one
host-write period after the command word consumes silently loses a word to
the one-deep transmit latch. Protocol v24 gates every multi-word upload on a
`$524459` ready token the DSP sends from immediately before its parked
receive loop.

## Embedded second-stage program loader

The 68030 executable now embeds both a 111-word first-stage boot image and the
sparse final P-memory image. XBIOS `Dsp_ExecBoot` resets the DSP and installs
the first stage in internal P RAM. Its reset vector jumps to `P:$0040`; the
final YM program deliberately begins at `P:$0080`, leaving
`P:$0040-$007f` untouched while the loader receives the complete program
through `Dsp_BlkUnpacked`.

The generated stream starts with magic `$4d584c`, followed by a section count
and address/count/data records. The low program sections end below `P:$1400`
and the stream carries both islands as additional sparse sections through
`P:$2ba6`. The current image contains 7,865 initialized program words in
fourteen merged sections. After installing them, the loader replies `$4c4f41`
and jumps through
the replaced reset vector at `P:$0000`. The build generator rejects a bootstrap
above the 512-word XBIOS limit, any overlap with the reserved loader gap, non-P
sections, sections outside 16-bit P memory, and any section that neither
stays below the `P:$1400` table boundary nor fits inside one of the declared
`[$2000,$2b00)` and `[$2b20,$3400)` islands.
This removes the former 8 KiB converted-LOD ceiling from future specialized or
unrolled kernels; the actual Falcon P-memory reservation is now the relevant
limit.
