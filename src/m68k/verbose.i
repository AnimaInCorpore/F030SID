; Optional boot/init tracing for real-hardware bring-up.
;
; Assemble with -DVERBOSE_BOOT to compile the markers in; without it every
; VB/VBH expands to nothing, so the normal f030sid.tos and xevious.tos
; builds are unaffected. Requires xbios.i (for Cconws) to be included first.
;
; Every blocking XBIOS/DSP step prints its label BEFORE the call and its
; result AFTER, so a hang leaves the label on screen with no result behind
; it: the last complete line is the last step that finished, and the
; dangling label names the call that never returned.
