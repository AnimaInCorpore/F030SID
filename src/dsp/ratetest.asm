; F030SID SSI rate-measurement DSP program
;
; Standalone Dsp_ExecBoot image for release/ratetest.tos. The 68030 owns the
; crossbar routing; this program only keeps the SSI transmitter fed with
; silence, counts transmit word slots and frame syncs, and reports its
; counters over the host port. A frame counter that never advances therefore
; means the crossbar delivers no SSI clock at the connected prescale - the
; exact real-hardware question the polled design isolates from the
; production kernel.
;
; The first physical-Falcon run (2026-09-02) found exactly that: no frames at
; any prescale with the bare bring-up, while the production player, which
; pins the whole sound matrix and only arms its transmitter after Devconnect,
; does play. The host side now bisects the bring-up, and this program gained
; the two commands that needs: a word-slot counter beside the frame counter,
; so a dead clock is told apart from a transmitter that runs without frame
; syncs, and a transmitter re-arm the host issues after Devconnect.
;
; The whole program stays inside the 512-word Dsp_ExecBoot window and uses no
; interrupts, so the reset state of IPR and the mode register is left alone.
;
; Keep the command words in sync with src/m68k/ratetest.s.
